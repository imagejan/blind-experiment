Blind Experiment
================

This is a small set of plugins to assist with a blind analysis of image data.
Image filenames can be masked with random UUIDs. The UUID - filename
associations are saved in a properties (props) file. This file can
then be used to unblind filenames or results from the image analysis.

Usage:
------

* *Analyze > Blind Experiment > Blind Files* to mask filenames before analysis
* *Analyze > Blind Experiment > Unblind Files* to unmask filenames after analysis
* *Analyze > Blind Experiment > Unblind Results Table* to unmask labels of a results table
* *Analyze > Blind Experiment > Record Comment* to record a comment as a results table entry
